# COSTS.md

This document is intended to track the token usage and associated costs incurred during the development of the E15 K-Means Interactive Application using AI assistance.

## Note on Tracking

As an AI model, I do not have direct access to real-time token usage or cost data. This file serves as a placeholder to indicate where such information would be recorded if integrated with a system that monitors API calls and their associated costs.

## Estimated Token Usage (Placeholder)

| Date       | Description                                  | Estimated Tokens Used | Estimated Cost (USD) |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------- |
| 2025-10-31 | Initial project analysis and setup           | [Approx. Tokens]      | [Approx. Cost]       |
| 2025-10-31 | E11 project analysis                         | [Approx. Tokens]      | [Approx. Cost]       |
| 2025-10-31 | Core logic (data_generator, kmeans_model)    | [Approx. Tokens]      | [Approx. Cost]       |
| 2025-10-31 | UI development (ui_app, controls)            | [Approx. Tokens]      | [Approx. Cost]       |
| 2025-10-31 | Visualization refinement                     | [Approx. Tokens]      | [Approx. Cost]       |
| 2025-10-31 | Documentation (DECISIONS, TODO, CHAT, COSTS) | [Approx. Tokens]      | [Approx. Cost]       |
| **Total**  |                                              | **[Total Tokens]**    | **[Total Cost]**     |

## Cost Calculation (Example)

*   **Model:** Gemini 1.5 Pro
*   **Input Token Cost:** $0.007 / 1K tokens
*   **Output Token Cost:** $0.021 / 1K tokens

*(These values are illustrative and would be replaced with actual pricing for the specific AI model used.)*
