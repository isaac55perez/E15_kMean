# TODO.md

This document lists remaining tasks, potential improvements, and future considerations for the E15 K-Means Interactive Application.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] **FR6.3: Display K-Means Computation Time:** Implemented by printing to the console.
- [x] **FR8.1: Create `README.md`:** Provided comprehensive instructions for installation, usage, and project overview.
- [x] **FR8.5: Create `CHAT.md`:** Documented the conversation history and key decisions made during the AI-assisted development process.
- [x] **FR8.6: Create `COSTS.md`:** Created a placeholder for tracking token usage and associated costs.
- [x] **Core Functionality (FR1-FR7):** All core functional requirements for data generation, K-Means clustering, UI controls, and visualization have been implemented and verified.

## Remaining Tasks & Future Enhancements

### UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] **Display Computation Time in UI:** Move the computation time display from the console to a dedicated UI element.
- [ ] **Refine Layout:** Improve the layout of controls for a more polished user experience.
- [ ] **Add Visual Feedback:** Implement more visual cues for user actions (e.g., highlighting the selected group, showing a loading indicator during computation).

### Performance & Responsiveness
- [ ] **Thoroughly Test Performance:** Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure UI responsiveness and fast visualization updates, especially with large datasets.

### Code Quality & Maintainability
- [ ] **Add Comprehensive Docstrings:** Enhance code documentation with detailed docstrings for all functions and classes.
- [ ] **Conduct Final PEP 8 Review:** Perform a final code review to ensure full adherence to PEP 8 style guidelines.

### Future Features
- [ ] **Export Functionality:** Add options to save generated data, clustering results, or visualizations.
- [ ] **Support for Other Algorithms:** Extend the application to include other clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, Spectral Clustering, Kernel K-Means) to explore different types of decision boundaries (e.g., curved).
- [ ] **Dataset Loading:** Allow users to load their own datasets.
- [ ] **Advanced Visualization:** Implement more advanced visualization techniques, such as 3D plots or animations.
- [ ] **Robust Error Handling:** Add more comprehensive error handling for user inputs and unexpected conditions.
